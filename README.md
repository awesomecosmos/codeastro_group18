# CodeAstro Project for Group 18

**Project Idea**:

Background
----------
The team of developers are Aayushi Verma, Kim Paragas, and Maria Babakhanyan Stone (in alphabetical order).
The idea of this project was created by Maria Babakhanyan Stone (University of Turku, Finland) for the group project during the Code Astro 2021 workshop.

Idea
----------
This is a calculator which takes a table of inputs (standard measurements from photometric imaging of galaxies and outputs the mass of the galaxy.
The user is required to input a table following the format specifications.

Current version specifications
----------
The current version of the calculator only calculates for infrared bands H and Ks.
The calculation does not take into account currently the various corrections to the absolute magnitude which may be required for some projects (e.g. k-correction, atmospheric extinction correction).
The magnitudes are in the AB magnitude system.
